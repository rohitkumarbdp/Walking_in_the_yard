        <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
        <p>You have a set \( M \) consisting of \( n \) vectors in a \( d \)-dimensional space. Each vector has a length of at most 1. When you add all these vectors together, they sum to zero.</p>
        <img src="../static/proof_circle.jpeg" alt="" style="width:70%;height:70%;margin-left: 10%;">
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>You want to arrange these vectors in a sequence (\( v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \)) so that as you add them up one by one, the length of the resulting sum never exceeds \( d \).</p>

        <h3>Example for Better Understanding</h3>
        <p>Imagine walking in a yard, and each vector represents a step you take. The goal is to ensure that at no point does your total distance from the start exceed a certain limit, which is \( d \) in this case.</p>

        <h3>The Theorem</h3>
        <p>The theorem states that it is always possible to find such an order for any set \( M \).</p>

        <h3>Proof Strategy</h3>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> A "good" set of vectors is one where you can find a special combination of the vectors that sums to zero and meets certain criteria. If a set is "good," its total length when summed up is at most \( d \).</p>

        <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> If you have more than \( d \) vectors in a "good" set, you can always remove one vector and still have a "good" set. This allows you to reduce the problem step by step.</p>

        <h3>Detailed Steps</h3>
        <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> If you have a system of linear equations with a solution in the range [0, 1], you can find another solution where most variables are either 0 or 1.</p>

        <p><strong>Inductive Proof:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with all vectors in \( M \), which is a "good" set.</li>
            <li>Remove vectors one by one while maintaining the "good" property.</li>
            <li>Continue this until only \( d \) vectors are left. This gives you the required order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why It Works</h3>
        <p>By carefully choosing which vector to remove, you ensure that the sum of the vectors at any stage does not exceed \( d \).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This method guarantees that for any finite set of vectors, you can find a sequence that keeps the total length of summed vectors within a certain limit at every step.</p>
